## PLEASE NOTE
## Usage Guidelines

To replicate the exact classes and results as presented in our original paper, **researchers are advised to use the `tensorflow.strings.unicode_split` function**. This function ensures a consistent split of phonemes, especially when handling complex Bengali characters with diacritical marks or under-dots.

## Phoneme Splitting in TensorFlow

When using TensorFlow’s string-splitting functions, certain phonemes with **diacritical marks or under-dot modifications** (such as **ড়, র, ঢ়, য়**) may result in **variable class separations**. For example:

- In the word **'বাড়ি'** (bari), the phoneme **‘ড়’** may be split into distinct units.
- In contrast, in the word **'দাড়ি'** (hari), the same phoneme **remains fixed** during splitting.

These cases are illustrated in the following figure for clarity.
